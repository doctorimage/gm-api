Graspable Math is an interactive algebra notation. It makes algebra explorable, even for beginners, by transforming pen and paper derivations into a dynamic, digital form. Visit the [Graspable Math homepage](https://graspablemath.com) to learn more.

If you are a developer, head over to the [Quick Start](https://github.com/eweitnauer/gm-api/blob/master/quickstart.md) and the [API Reference](https://github.com/eweitnauer/gm-api/blob/master/API.md) to learn about how you can integrate GM into your webpages. Using GM is free as long as you are not earning any money with it. To use GM in a commercial context, contact us at contact@graspablemath.com.
